## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔐 [Syphr](https://github.com/lentzsch/Syphr)

A messaging app that is really a thinly veiled excuse to build a full Enigma machine emulator in Python.
My capstone project at App Academy and a personal favorite.
Includes historically accurate spy codenames from WWII’s XX Committee as seed data.

### 🎮 [GoodGames.GG](https://github.com/jiezheng2020/GoodGamesGG)

A group-built Goodreads clone for video games.
My first-ever project—humble beginnings with Pug and AJAX.

### 🎤 [Scratch.io](https://github.com/JoshuaJDevine/scratch.io)

An Eventbrite clone for game jams. I architected the backend and team logic,
including flexible `to_dict` model methods. A solid backend… attached to a very confused frontend.
